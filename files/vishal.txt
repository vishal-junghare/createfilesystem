A backend developer is a software engineer who specializes in creating and maintaining the server-side logic, databases, and infrastructure of a web application or software. They are responsible for writing clean, efficient, and scalable code that powers the functionality of the application, as well as integrating with front-end components and ensuring the smooth operation of the entire system. A backend developer typically works with languages and frameworks such as Python, Java, Ruby on Rails, and Node.js, and is proficient in database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. They also collaborate closely with front-end developers, designers, and other team members to deliver a seamless and high-performing user experience.
